        <title>Testes e Avaliação</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Student-centered and self-organized learning is not the same as laissez faire.
I’m continually impressed by the energy with which students search for
new ways to assess and document their own progress. As lifelong learners,
we all need systems of assessment that can provide us with feedback on
our performance. Self-assessment places more responsibility on the student
than assessment by others, but students are well aware that waiting for
their institution and/or teachers to assess and guide their learning is not a
promising option.
Some feedback can be enabled by technology. One of the most interesting
uses of IT in education is digital portfolios of the kind already in use at
ICT companies such as Sun. Digital portfolios provide an ongoing record of
work that can be continually added to and reshaped.44 Portfolios collect
detailed information on the development of students over an extended
period of time and serve as what Howard Gardner describes as a ‘‘record of
growth’’: They can include the history of a specific project or a broader picture
of progress over a longer period of time. According to Gardner, portfolios
can be assessed (by instructors, but also by the learners themselves)
against a variety of measures: the number and richness of entries, the
degree and quality of reflection demonstrated, quantitative improvement
in a technical skill, achievement of goals, and so on.45
The fact that a portfolio is created and stored digitally is not a big deal. I
remember as a child being asked to keep a ‘‘commonplace book,’’ and my
own daughter today accumulates hardcover books containing project work,
records of visits to museums, and reflections. Where ‘‘digital’’ can really
add value is by leveraging the power of networks to enable peer assessment.
For J. C. Herz, who studies the relationship between online gaming and
learning, what underlies the dynamics of networked online environments
is the process whereby individuals are evaluated and rewarded by the system
itself, rather than by a specific individual. This process is perhaps
most evident in massive multiplayer role-playing games (RPGs) like Sony’s
Everquest, Electronic Arts’ Ultima Online, or Microsoft’s Asheron’s Call. For
Herz, ‘‘the RPG game persona is the most fully dimensional representation
of a person’s accumulated knowledge and experience in the months and
years they spend in an online environment.’’46&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tecnologia e Redes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When wiring up schools to the Internet fails to deliver instant, dramatic
results—which is nearly always—politicians often blame teachers, whom
they have long tended to regard as an impediment to technological modernization.
The real culprits are policymakers who think of technology as a
cost-saving cure-all. Serious budgets are persistently voted for the hardware
of connectivity (computers, modems, and so on), but grossly inadequate
resources tend to be allocated to content and process development—the
what and how of learning in new ways. Education planners have persistently
ignored the advice of their own software suppliers that 30–40
percent of any technology budget should be devoted to staff training and
organizational development.
Outside education, larger companies reckon that their true ICT costs—
when equipment, training, technical support, connectivity and hosting,
software licenses, and so on are taken into account—are about ten thousand
dollars a year per person. No government in the world invests that
amount to support technology in schools. In the United States and Europe,
head teachers and principals would count themselves lucky to have a technology
budget of ten thousand dollars per school.41 International Data
Corporation has calculated that the total cost of ownership (TCO) for a
school with seventy-five computers is $2,251 per year per computer,
whereas for a comparably sized small business its TCO is $4,517 per computer,
or more than twice that amount.42 Tom Stewart, author of Intellectual
Capital, puts the figure for business computing much higher: He states
that the five-year costs of supporting a client-server computing network is
$48,000 per person.43
The total amount spent on technology is not the most important point.
I argued earlier that the main promise of technology does not lie in putting
course notes and lecture transcripts online. That’s the start, not the end,
of the process. Technology becomes interesting when it facilitates new
kinds of interaction among teachers, students, and the external world—
and this does not need to be expensive. To get the most out of technology
and networks, new skills and attitudes are needed—and these either are
free or can be taught. Search skills are important, for example. With billions
of pages and countless educational objects already on the Web, the skill
of understanding how to search for things and how to evaluate online material
is critical. The new learning economy values hits and links: Learning
how to be found and how to link is also a core skill. Vital, too, are the editing
skills students need as they find, evaluate, organize, and communicate
all kinds of media assets: video, photographs, or computer files. Different
ways to share knowledge and experience also need to be explored: file sharing,
peer-to-peer knowledge exchange over the Net. File sharing is not just
about music: It is more important as an infrastructure and a culture that
enables collaboration and interaction among learners.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sítio e Espaço</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The concept of a ‘‘death of distance’’ made great headlines when Internet
rhetoric was at its height. Its grandchild is the concept of ‘‘anytime, anywhere
learning.’’ This idea sounds attractive and uncontroversial—until
one realizes that it describes a point-to-mass distribution model of learning
that overlooks the significance of place and the localization of knowledge.
Learning depends on place, time, and context. An exclusive focus on
schools and colleges as sites of learning and the distribute-then-learn model
of e-learning both fail to exploit these more complex geographies of learning.
As Seely Brown and Duguid emphasize in The Social Life of Information,
a lot of what we learn is remarkably local: history, agriculture, politics, art,
geology, viticulture, forestry, conservation, ocean science. A great deal of
learning also takes place in what these authors describe as ‘‘an ecology of
local or regional sites of professional excellence: research labs, hospitals,
architects’ and design offices, Web design studios, and the like—anywhere,
indeed, that people gather together to work. Knowledge as it grows is necessarily
social, the shared property of extended groups and networks.’’37 All
spaces, places, and communities that foster complex experiences and processes
are potential sites of learning.
New geographies of learning need to be based on redesigned configurations
of space, place, and network that respect the social and collaborative
nature of learning—while still exploiting the dynamic potential of networked
collaboration. We need to design the spatial configuration of education
so that it connects communities and learners that, right now, tend
to be separated from one another.38
Breaking down the walls that divide ‘‘school’’ and ‘‘work’’ and ‘‘home’’
entails challenging cultural and institutional changes—but it can be done.
The municipal infant-toddler centers and preschools of Reggio Emilia in
Italy, for example, are internationally recognized as a model of ‘‘relational
space’’ planning in which buildings are relatively neutral in the use of colors,
much like an art museum, so that the activities and work of the children
become the focus of the space. (Documentation is central to the
Reggio approach, and the architecture is designed to encourage playful
encounters for the preschool students.) In Reggio the built environment is
considered a ‘‘third teacher’’—not only in the sense that it facilitates learning,
but also because it explicitly acts as a connector that supports a networked,
community-based organization and acts as a hub for the whole
community. ‘‘In a relational space,’’ says the noted Italian design researcher
Giulio Ceppi, ‘‘the predominant feature is that of the relationships it enables,
the many specialized activities that can be carried out there, and the
information and cultural filters that can be activated within the space.’’39
The design emphasis in Reggio Emilia is on relationships, rather than
on what the space looks like. Educational theories change faster than
the buildings they are tested in. Many middle-aged Europeans went to
schools built decades earlier whose windows were set purposefully high
so that children would not be distracted by the outside world. I spent my
own teenage years in buildings designed by a Victorian prison architect;
his expertise with security and iron bars persuaded the founders of
Marlborough College that he was the ideal person to build a school for
teenage boys. Maybe they were right—but I cannot recall being bothered
by my school buildings one way or another. What I do remember (fondly,
for the most part) are teachers and fellow pupils and some of the things we
did together.
What matters most to all learners is activity, not architecture. We all deserve
to spend time in safe, pleasant, and comfortable surroundings, rather
than their opposite. Beyond that, most buildings will do. What learning
needs most is a lot more space, as well as time, than it gets right now.
There’s no need to purpose-build huge numbers of schools and colleges.
Fine calculations about square meters per child or the relative merits of discrete
classrooms along corridors versus communal halls are secondary
issues. We need double, triple the space we have now, for learning. The
world is filled with abandoned or underused cinemas, gas stations, power
plants, warehouses, and railway yards. We should commandeer them for
learning. As I suggested in chapters 3 and 4, we can use the resource management
systems pioneered in the logistics industry to combine learners
and spaces in new ways and at new times.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Receber ao Aprender</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a mismatch between the kind of learning prescribed by these
enlightened experts and what many employers perceive to be their shortterm
needs. As a result of this mismatch, the school-to-work transition has
become an increasingly difficult phase, and many employers now take their
own direct training measures. These tend to be heavy on applied skills—
and light on metacognitive ones.8 We might reject the narrow focus of
much corporate education, but it’s partly our own fault as a society. We
have filled the world with such unstable technology and clunky systems;
these need to be looked after by people with limited horizons who do
what they are told and don’t ask too many questions. Call centers—to
name just one among a thousand support functions in our technological
culture—don’t recruit people with metacognitive skills who look at the
bigger picture. They need drones.
The widening gap between what formal education provides and what
business thinks it needs has stimulated the emergence of learning as a market.
This market also benefits from the fact that governments are looking
for ways to educate more people to ever higher levels—but without spending
more money. They therefore encourage private-sector investment in
what is known in new-economy-speak as the ‘‘education space.’’
On paper, education, like health and care, is a vast market. Spending on
learning by all organizations in the United States amounts to some seven
hundred fifty billion dollars, or 7 percent of GDP. That’s half what the
country spends on health, but still a tidy sum. In France, Europe’s highest
spender on education, the number is closer to 25 percent.9 Spending by all
organizations worldwide is estimated to be two thousand billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. firms spend a big chunk of that total on internal training. The so-called
consumer market for learning is also huge. Two hundred million North
Americans take some kind of continuing education course each year, and
nine out of ten adults aged fifty and over are actively seeking learning
opportunities at any given time. These are remarkable numbers when compared
to annual sales of tickets to sporting events in the United States,
which total just ten million.10
The approach business has taken to the learning market has been to
segment it. An influential paper by Jerry Wind and David Reibstein at
Wharton Business School11 divided education into discrete markets: child
care and early education, K–12 or secondary education, postsecondary education,
corporate training, and the consumer market. Another popular matrix
divides learning into content (information technology, business skills,
lifestyle, academic, customized), services (content distribution, consulting,
implementation, e-commerce, community portals), and technology (learning
management tools, digital portfolios, content creation tools, delivery
platforms, collaboration tools).
There was a time when market analyses of this kind, combined with the
huge financial numbers bandied around, greatly excited investors. There
was talk of an ‘‘emerging electronic university,’’ a ninety-billion-dollar
‘‘unified global marketplace for ideas,’’ ‘‘Web-based knowledge exchanges,’’
and so on.12 One start-up, UNext, proclaimed that ‘‘the vast imbalance between
the supply and demand for quality education provides an enormous,
untapped global market. Countries, companies, and individuals that don’t
invest in knowledge are destined to fall behind.’’13
This bewitching vision enticed investors to pour billions of dollars of
venture capital onto the e-learning bandwagon during the last years of the
dot-com boom. A lot of this money went to so-called pure-play learning
start-ups following a ‘‘land grab’’ or first-mover-advantage strategy. These
start-ups thought it vital to own or control access to as much content as
possible. ‘‘We are continually combing the Net to feed our growing database
of 37,000 online courses,’’ boasted the website of HungryMinds (now
defunct).14 Other start-ups proclaimed themselves to be ‘‘learning portals’’
through which all conceivable types of knowledge and learning would
be accessed and exchanged. Blue-chip players were not immune from the
frenzy. Columbia University invested tens of millions of dollars in Fathom,
a learning portal, and recruited a consortium of fellow blue-chip academic
institutions to join them; these included the London School of Economics,
the New York Public Library, and the Universities of Chicago and Michigan.
Industry gossip at the time had it that Fathom spent seventy-five
million dollars building its portal website before the service was even
launched.15
Most e-learning start-ups were inspired by a simple idea: They would
make money by ‘‘dis-intermediating’’ disposable steps in the production
process of learning—namely, people. They compared the people costs of
education (which are up to 80 percent) with those in manufacturing (20–
40 percent) and services (around 60 percent)—and concluded that it must
surely be possible to produce learning in a more profitable way by automating
the process.16
The e-learning investment bubble burst when, in 2001, MIT announced
that it would put all its content online—and access would be free. The university
further committed one hundred million dollars to a project called
OpenCourseWare in which public-domain websites would be built for all
of its two thousand courses. Lecture notes, problem sets, syllabuses, simulations,
even videos of lectures would be put online. As Charles Vest, MIT’s
president, said at the time, ‘‘our central value is people, and the human experience
of faculty working with students.’’17
The private sector was not uniquely to blame for a skewed vision of
learning that prioritized prerecorded content over people. Visions of a
vast, semiautomated learning machine still bewitch many politicians—
not just entrepreneurs—and the world is replete with government-backed
plans to ‘‘penetrate the schools’’ with new technology. A senior Dutch
minister once told me confidently that with the Internet, ‘‘we can beam
lectures from the best 10 percent of teachers to classrooms and do without
the other 90 percent.’’ The minister’s dream reminded me of a joke I once
heard in Hungary about the factory of the future. It will have only two
employees, a man and a dog: The man will be there to feed the dog; the
dog will be there to stop the man from touching the equipment.
Evangelists for computers in schools are perplexed that the computer
revolution has moved so slowly. They observe that some areas of human
activity—medicine, transportation, entertainment—have changed beyond
recognition in the wake of modern science and technology. One institution
that most definitely has not is school. MIT’s Seymour Papert has a vision
of a truly modern school in which the computer is as much part of all
learning as the pencil and the book have been in the past. In Papert’s
vision, computer-based media would enable children to master areas of
knowledge that would otherwise remain inaccessibly difficult. Self-directed
work would allow an unprecedented diversity of learning styles and opportunity
for students to learn to take charge of their own learning. According
to Papert, American schools have acquired more than three million computers,
yet resistance to progress persists.18&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Time redesign, in the form of more flexible schedules, has started to emerge
in some real-world schools. Thomas Telford, one of the highest-performing public
schools in the United Kingdom, also has the longest school day in that country—
between 31 and 35 hours a week, compared to a U.K. national average of 23.5.
According to the Design Council, which has studied the case, these longer hours are
less chopped up and predetermined than is usual in the British system. Each day is
divided into two sessions, morning and afternoon. Staggered lunch and breakfast
breaks limit congestion and disruption. A pupil will spend the whole morning on a
subject, usually in the same classroom, but with a number of different teachers who
work in a team. Hilary Cottam, ed., Changing Behaviors (London: Design Council,

  &lt;li&gt;The number of computers obtained by U.S. schools and used by teachers and
students increased throughout the 1990s, as it had during the previous decade. However,
according to a paper published in March 2004 for the Office of Technology Assessment,
the fact that computers are used primarily by one or two students at a time
means that the density of computers in comparison to the number of potential student
users remains small. Henry Jay Becker, Analysis and Trends of School Use of New

        <title>Aprender de forma Massiça e Colaborativa</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Mentors and intimate conversation are clearly important. But the complex
challenges facing us will not be confronted unless we find ways to enable
rapid, mass, large-scale learning, too. J. C. Herz’s investigations of the online
gaming world reveal numerous examples of networks in which professionals—particularly
those involved in fast-evolving technical domains—
share information and experience. As Howard Rheingold confirms so
cogently in Smart Mobs, we don’t have to reinvent the concept of collaboration:
It’s in our nature as humans to collaborate, and this existing social
characteristic is being amplified and accelerated by new communication
tools ranging from data mining and ratings software to wireless devices.50
A well-known example is Slashdot,51 a website for technology news and
discussion. Unlike that of a traditional technical journal, in which a small
team of specialist writers roam the world’s trade fairs and labs and then
write articles about technology, the editorial content of Slashdot is created
by its users. Any Slashdotter can submit a text or comment on one
already there. Submissions to Slashdot are filtered and rated by moderators.
Despite the craze for ‘‘social software’’ and the growth of websites such
as LinkedIn and Orkut that promise to revolutionize our social and profesional
lives, the Internet does not own mass collaboration. In all forms
of learning, the best collaboration involves live contact, and this, too, can
be designed. To give just one example, ‘‘OroOro’’ was a three-day event
organized by Caroline Nevejan, research director of the Amsterdam University
of Professional Education, with its twenty-two thousand students and
more than one thousand teachers. Nevejan was looking for ways to support
collaboration among teachers fatigued by years of forced continuous
reorganization and by a government intent on pushing more and more
students through the system. Many of the university’s teachers were being
confronted by students who knew more about the technical details
of their subject—for example, Java programming—than the teachers did.
It was a recipe for demoralization. ‘‘My job was not to bring in yet more
technology—we already had that,’’ Nevejan told me at the time, ‘‘but to
design processes that would enable our teachers and students to make
better use of new tools.’’ The aim of ‘‘OroOro’’ was to accelerate this new
approach. Part symposium, part hands-on workshop, it enabled 1,000
teachers to explore together new ways to organize relationships between
what—and who—we know.52
The lesson of projects like ‘‘OroOro’’ is that communities of practice
can be designed—in this case, within a single institution—and they are
not principally about technology. Communities of practice are defined by
a common disciplinary background, similar work activities and tools, and
shared stories, contexts, and values. They are not defined by the technology
that helps them function. IBM, to its credit, has put hard numbers on
the fact that communities of practice grow through time; they are not built
with tech. It investigated communities of practice within several large
organizations, including IBM, Scandinavian Airline Systems, World Bank,
United Technologies, and British Telecom, and identified and priced four
major cost drivers:
m the cost of participation time for community members (52 percent)
m meeting and conference expenses (32 percent)
m technology (10 percent)
m content publishing and promotional expenses (6 percent)53&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Aprender como um Tema de Design</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Podes lembrar-te de publicidade para um serviço de empresas que têm características como um cano de água, atado num nó, à volta da cabeça duma pessoa. Uma gota de água solitária que saí da ponta aberta do cano. A metáfora visual da publicidade e texto acompanhantes eram acerca da renovação de informação para dentro da nossa cabeça, um bocado como encher um balde.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pensamento cano-e-balde premia a politica que tem a ver com aprender e educação. O governo britânico até está a contruir uma “Grelha Nacional de Aprender” Isso vai conectar todas as escolas à internet. É uma excelente política metafórica - Conhecimento para todos, tal como água ou eletrecidade. Mas é um modelo ultrapassado de aprender. Aprender é complexo, social e um processo multidimêncional que não se empresta para ser mandado do cano abaixo-por exemplo, dum website. Conhecimento, perceber, sabedoria-ou “contexto,” se me permitirem-são qualidades desenvolvidas com tempo. Não é uma coisa que é enviada.&lt;/p&gt;
