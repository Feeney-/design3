    <p>The concept of a ‘‘death of distance’’ made great headlines when Internet
rhetoric was at its height. Its grandchild is the concept of ‘‘anytime, anywhere
learning.’’ This idea sounds attractive and uncontroversial—until
one realizes that it describes a point-to-mass distribution model of learning
that overlooks the significance of place and the localization of knowledge.
Learning depends on place, time, and context. An exclusive focus on
schools and colleges as sites of learning and the distribute-then-learn model
of e-learning both fail to exploit these more complex geographies of learning.
As Seely Brown and Duguid emphasize in The Social Life of Information,
a lot of what we learn is remarkably local: history, agriculture, politics, art,
geology, viticulture, forestry, conservation, ocean science. A great deal of
learning also takes place in what these authors describe as ‘‘an ecology of
local or regional sites of professional excellence: research labs, hospitals,
architects’ and design offices, Web design studios, and the like—anywhere,
indeed, that people gather together to work. Knowledge as it grows is necessarily
social, the shared property of extended groups and networks.’’37 All
spaces, places, and communities that foster complex experiences and processes
are potential sites of learning.
New geographies of learning need to be based on redesigned configurations
of space, place, and network that respect the social and collaborative
nature of learning—while still exploiting the dynamic potential of networked
collaboration. We need to design the spatial configuration of education
so that it connects communities and learners that, right now, tend
to be separated from one another.38
Breaking down the walls that divide ‘‘school’’ and ‘‘work’’ and ‘‘home’’
entails challenging cultural and institutional changes—but it can be done.
The municipal infant-toddler centers and preschools of Reggio Emilia in
Italy, for example, are internationally recognized as a model of ‘‘relational
space’’ planning in which buildings are relatively neutral in the use of colors,
much like an art museum, so that the activities and work of the children
become the focus of the space. (Documentation is central to the
Reggio approach, and the architecture is designed to encourage playful
encounters for the preschool students.) In Reggio the built environment is
considered a ‘‘third teacher’’—not only in the sense that it facilitates learning,
but also because it explicitly acts as a connector that supports a networked,
community-based organization and acts as a hub for the whole
community. ‘‘In a relational space,’’ says the noted Italian design researcher
Giulio Ceppi, ‘‘the predominant feature is that of the relationships it enables,
the many specialized activities that can be carried out there, and the
information and cultural filters that can be activated within the space.’’39
The design emphasis in Reggio Emilia is on relationships, rather than
on what the space looks like. Educational theories change faster than
the buildings they are tested in. Many middle-aged Europeans went to
schools built decades earlier whose windows were set purposefully high
so that children would not be distracted by the outside world. I spent my
own teenage years in buildings designed by a Victorian prison architect;
his expertise with security and iron bars persuaded the founders of
Marlborough College that he was the ideal person to build a school for
teenage boys. Maybe they were right—but I cannot recall being bothered
by my school buildings one way or another. What I do remember (fondly,
for the most part) are teachers and fellow pupils and some of the things we
did together.
What matters most to all learners is activity, not architecture. We all deserve
to spend time in safe, pleasant, and comfortable surroundings, rather
than their opposite. Beyond that, most buildings will do. What learning
needs most is a lot more space, as well as time, than it gets right now.
There’s no need to purpose-build huge numbers of schools and colleges.
Fine calculations about square meters per child or the relative merits of discrete
classrooms along corridors versus communal halls are secondary
issues. We need double, triple the space we have now, for learning. The
world is filled with abandoned or underused cinemas, gas stations, power
plants, warehouses, and railway yards. We should commandeer them for
learning. As I suggested in chapters 3 and 4, we can use the resource management
systems pioneered in the logistics industry to combine learners
and spaces in new ways and at new times.</p>
