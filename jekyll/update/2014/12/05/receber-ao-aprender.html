    <p>There is a mismatch between the kind of learning prescribed by these
enlightened experts and what many employers perceive to be their shortterm
needs. As a result of this mismatch, the school-to-work transition has
become an increasingly difficult phase, and many employers now take their
own direct training measures. These tend to be heavy on applied skills—
and light on metacognitive ones.8 We might reject the narrow focus of
much corporate education, but it’s partly our own fault as a society. We
have filled the world with such unstable technology and clunky systems;
these need to be looked after by people with limited horizons who do
what they are told and don’t ask too many questions. Call centers—to
name just one among a thousand support functions in our technological
culture—don’t recruit people with metacognitive skills who look at the
bigger picture. They need drones.
The widening gap between what formal education provides and what
business thinks it needs has stimulated the emergence of learning as a market.
This market also benefits from the fact that governments are looking
for ways to educate more people to ever higher levels—but without spending
more money. They therefore encourage private-sector investment in
what is known in new-economy-speak as the ‘‘education space.’’
On paper, education, like health and care, is a vast market. Spending on
learning by all organizations in the United States amounts to some seven
hundred fifty billion dollars, or 7 percent of GDP. That’s half what the
country spends on health, but still a tidy sum. In France, Europe’s highest
spender on education, the number is closer to 25 percent.9 Spending by all
organizations worldwide is estimated to be two thousand billion dollars.</p>

<p>U.S. firms spend a big chunk of that total on internal training. The so-called
consumer market for learning is also huge. Two hundred million North
Americans take some kind of continuing education course each year, and
nine out of ten adults aged fifty and over are actively seeking learning
opportunities at any given time. These are remarkable numbers when compared
to annual sales of tickets to sporting events in the United States,
which total just ten million.10
The approach business has taken to the learning market has been to
segment it. An influential paper by Jerry Wind and David Reibstein at
Wharton Business School11 divided education into discrete markets: child
care and early education, K–12 or secondary education, postsecondary education,
corporate training, and the consumer market. Another popular matrix
divides learning into content (information technology, business skills,
lifestyle, academic, customized), services (content distribution, consulting,
implementation, e-commerce, community portals), and technology (learning
management tools, digital portfolios, content creation tools, delivery
platforms, collaboration tools).
There was a time when market analyses of this kind, combined with the
huge financial numbers bandied around, greatly excited investors. There
was talk of an ‘‘emerging electronic university,’’ a ninety-billion-dollar
‘‘unified global marketplace for ideas,’’ ‘‘Web-based knowledge exchanges,’’
and so on.12 One start-up, UNext, proclaimed that ‘‘the vast imbalance between
the supply and demand for quality education provides an enormous,
untapped global market. Countries, companies, and individuals that don’t
invest in knowledge are destined to fall behind.’’13
This bewitching vision enticed investors to pour billions of dollars of
venture capital onto the e-learning bandwagon during the last years of the
dot-com boom. A lot of this money went to so-called pure-play learning
start-ups following a ‘‘land grab’’ or first-mover-advantage strategy. These
start-ups thought it vital to own or control access to as much content as
possible. ‘‘We are continually combing the Net to feed our growing database
of 37,000 online courses,’’ boasted the website of HungryMinds (now
defunct).14 Other start-ups proclaimed themselves to be ‘‘learning portals’’
through which all conceivable types of knowledge and learning would
be accessed and exchanged. Blue-chip players were not immune from the
frenzy. Columbia University invested tens of millions of dollars in Fathom,
a learning portal, and recruited a consortium of fellow blue-chip academic
institutions to join them; these included the London School of Economics,
the New York Public Library, and the Universities of Chicago and Michigan.
Industry gossip at the time had it that Fathom spent seventy-five
million dollars building its portal website before the service was even
launched.15
Most e-learning start-ups were inspired by a simple idea: They would
make money by ‘‘dis-intermediating’’ disposable steps in the production
process of learning—namely, people. They compared the people costs of
education (which are up to 80 percent) with those in manufacturing (20–
40 percent) and services (around 60 percent)—and concluded that it must
surely be possible to produce learning in a more profitable way by automating
the process.16
The e-learning investment bubble burst when, in 2001, MIT announced
that it would put all its content online—and access would be free. The university
further committed one hundred million dollars to a project called
OpenCourseWare in which public-domain websites would be built for all
of its two thousand courses. Lecture notes, problem sets, syllabuses, simulations,
even videos of lectures would be put online. As Charles Vest, MIT’s
president, said at the time, ‘‘our central value is people, and the human experience
of faculty working with students.’’17
The private sector was not uniquely to blame for a skewed vision of
learning that prioritized prerecorded content over people. Visions of a
vast, semiautomated learning machine still bewitch many politicians—
not just entrepreneurs—and the world is replete with government-backed
plans to ‘‘penetrate the schools’’ with new technology. A senior Dutch
minister once told me confidently that with the Internet, ‘‘we can beam
lectures from the best 10 percent of teachers to classrooms and do without
the other 90 percent.’’ The minister’s dream reminded me of a joke I once
heard in Hungary about the factory of the future. It will have only two
employees, a man and a dog: The man will be there to feed the dog; the
dog will be there to stop the man from touching the equipment.
Evangelists for computers in schools are perplexed that the computer
revolution has moved so slowly. They observe that some areas of human
activity—medicine, transportation, entertainment—have changed beyond
recognition in the wake of modern science and technology. One institution
that most definitely has not is school. MIT’s Seymour Papert has a vision
of a truly modern school in which the computer is as much part of all
learning as the pencil and the book have been in the past. In Papert’s
vision, computer-based media would enable children to master areas of
knowledge that would otherwise remain inaccessibly difficult. Self-directed
work would allow an unprecedented diversity of learning styles and opportunity
for students to learn to take charge of their own learning. According
to Papert, American schools have acquired more than three million computers,
yet resistance to progress persists.18</p>
