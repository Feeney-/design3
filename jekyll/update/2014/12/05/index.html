Universities, the University of Chicago, and the London School of Economics and
Political Science. By the autumn of 2001, citing the need to operate in a ‘‘fiscally conservative
manner,’’ the Deerfield, Illinois–based company had cut its workforce by 42
percent, laying off 135 of its 325 employees. Katherine S. Mangan, ‘‘Expectations

  <li>Fathom struggled to attract both students and outside investors, forcing the university
to spend ten million dollars after its launch to keep the project afloat. Over
sixty-five thousand of Fathom’s visitors enrolled in courses and seminars, and the
company went on to form alliances with such prestigious partners as the British
Broadcasting Company. But visitors are no longer able to purchase courses through
Fathom, which has become an archive website.</li>

  <li>Most colleges with significant e-learning offerings employ private companies—
e-learning call centers—that serve hundreds of colleges from the same technical
support center. Nortel Networks and United Parcel Service, which are active in this
market, charge institutions per-minute fees for each call or e-mail message that
comes in. With prices in the range of sixty to ninety cents a minute, a typical phone
call may cost an institution twenty dollars. This adds up.</li>
  <li>The University of Phoenix Online does not quote lump-sum prices for its MBA
programs, but its website states that ‘‘while the cost of attending a private college
is over $20,000 a year at some schools, the cost of attending University of Phoenix
Online is less than half that.’’ ‘‘Cost,’’ available on the University of Phoenix Online

  <li>Time redesign, in the form of more flexible schedules, has started to emerge
in some real-world schools. Thomas Telford, one of the highest-performing public
schools in the United Kingdom, also has the longest school day in that country—
between 31 and 35 hours a week, compared to a U.K. national average of 23.5.
According to the Design Council, which has studied the case, these longer hours are
less chopped up and predetermined than is usual in the British system. Each day is
divided into two sessions, morning and afternoon. Staggered lunch and breakfast
breaks limit congestion and disruption. A pupil will spend the whole morning on a
subject, usually in the same classroom, but with a number of different teachers who
work in a team. Hilary Cottam, ed., Changing Behaviors (London: Design Council,

  <li>The number of computers obtained by U.S. schools and used by teachers and
students increased throughout the 1990s, as it had during the previous decade. However,
according to a paper published in March 2004 for the Office of Technology Assessment,
the fact that computers are used primarily by one or two students at a time
means that the density of computers in comparison to the number of potential student
users remains small. Henry Jay Becker, Analysis and Trends of School Use of New
Information Technologies (report prepared for the U.S. Congress, Office of Technology
